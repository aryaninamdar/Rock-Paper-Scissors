# Rock-Paper-Scissors
One of my first projects in web development. This interactive website allows the user to play rock paper scissors with the computer.

## How to Play

Choose either rock paper or scissors. The computer will choose one of these randomley. Depending on which symbols are picked, you will either win or lose the round. For each round you win, you get a point. Try to get as many points as you can! 

## Output
When you open the webpage, the screen will look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15j9d1yM_w4PwZVqvQrAcSUCv-isarjyi/view?usp=sharing.
If you win a round, the screen will notify you, like so: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uX6zpxaZkf-1YVXDdY_lIbp-WU4Jww0f/view?usp=sharing. My score increments and the result message turns green to indicate that you won. However, if you lose, the screen will look like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqV3y-1L2OpOYU5eVcX6BIHQArdtTLQ4/view?usp=sharing. The computer's score increments and the result message turns red to indicate that you lost. If there is a draw, the result message will turn grey and no score will be increased.
